            <p>If you haven't met Langston Hughes before, do get this. Politically powerful, edgy, human and emotionally far ranging. He connects us to the USA past and present and although he left us a while ago, his words remain to help us make sense of today. A wonderful book and great introduction to the man's work.

            <p> Yes!!! I had to revisit this poet. He gets a lot of checkmarks for what I feel is great poetry writing. I hated his multiple references to death; however. I loved how he's an expert in tailoring the perfect length to what he has to say also. These are good selections from him, I love the grouping. Totally happy.</p>
