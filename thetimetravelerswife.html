            <p class="book-description">"The Time Traveler's Wife" is a science fiction romance novel by Audrey Niffenegger. The story follows Henry DeTamble, a man with a rare genetic disorder that causes him to involuntarily travel through time, and his wife, Clare Abshire, who has known him in both his past and future. The novel alternates between Henry's unpredictable time travels and Clare's perspective as she waits for him to return, experiencing the challenges of loving someone whose presence is uncertain and fleeting. The book explores themes of love, fate, loss, and the intricacies of time itself, making it both a heart-wrenching and thought-provoking narrative. It delves into the complexity of relationships when time itself is a constant disruption.</p>
