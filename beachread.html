            <p class="book-description">Beach Read follows the lives of two writers who are stuck in a creative rut. January Andrews is a successful author of romantic novels, while Gus Everett is a literary fiction writer struggling with his latest book. Both are facing personal and professional challenges. They end up spending the summer next door to each other at a beach house, each trying to overcome their writer’s block. They strike a deal to swap genres for the summer: January will write literary fiction, and Gus will write a romance novel. What starts as a professional challenge soon evolves into an emotional journey of self-discovery, love, and confronting past traumas.

                The novel is a perfect mix of humor, romance, and deep emotional themes, making it a perfect beach read—light yet meaningful.</p>
