                Robert Frost is one of the most celebrated American poets of the 20th century, known for his exploration of rural life and his mastery of American colloquial speech.

            <p>As a child, I was fascinated by Frost's poetry. As an adult, I was mesmerised by how eloquently and beautifully he could express the most complex of ideas and concepts. The enchantment remains. And the fanatic obsession too. This is a book that helps to satiate some of the obsession.

            <p> Awesome product, wish they wrapped it around the bubble sheet but anyway and really the price 440 is too high. For a small and 300 page book, and should be reduced around 200.</p>
